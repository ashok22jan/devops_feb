When you sign in to the AWS Management Console from the main AWS sign-in URL (https://console.aws.amazon.com/) you must choose your user type, either Root user or IAM user.

The root user has unrestricted account access and is associated with the person who created the AWS account. The root user then creates other types of users, such as IAM users and users in AWS IAM Identity Center, and assigns them access credentials.

An IAM user is an identity within your AWS account that has specific custom permissions. When an IAM user signs in, they can use a sign-in URL that includes their AWS account or alias, such as https://account_alias_or_id.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/ instead of the main AWS sign in URL https://console.aws.amazon.com/.

If you're not sure what kind of user you are, see User types.
